These are my notes on the xbel format, where I've made note of things which I found particularly pertinent to delectus

It is expected that software implementing the conversion be able to warn the user if conversion will cause the loss of information, as appropriate.

The <title> element is used to mark the title associated with the immediately enclosing element. It is used for the <xbel>, <folder>, and <bookmark> elements.

The <desc> element is used to store a human-readable description of the enclosing element. For a <bookmark>, a summary of the resource pointed to by the bookmark may be more appropriate.

The <folder> element is the element used to support hierarchical data organization. It is the only element type which is allowed to nest within itself. This element may contain optional <title>, <info> and <desc> elements.
<folders> attrs:
id 
ID value to allow linking to this element; only the <alias> element's ref attribute supports a corresponding IDREF value. 

added 
Date/time value which records when the folder was added to the bookmark collection represented by the instance. 

folded 
Token which records whether the contents of the folder should be displayed by default in a user interface. The value may be yes or no

A <bookmark> element is used to store information about a specific resource. This element may contain the optional elements <title>, <info> and <desc>.
<boomarks> attrs:
href, required 
URI which specifies the resource described by the <bookmark> element. 

id 
ID value to allow linking to this element; only the <alias> element's ref attribute supports a corresponding IDREF value. 

added 
Date/time value which indicates when the <bookmark> element was added to the bookmark collection. 

modified 
Date/time value which records the time of the last known change to the resource identified by the <bookmark>. 

visited 
Date/time value which represents the time of the user's last ``visit'' to the resource. Note that the value for modified may be more recent than the value for visited if software is used that checks for resources which have changed since the user last visited the resource. This feature is increasingly common in browsers.
