The following browsers have been tested with Delectus and are known to work:

Midori (0.1.7 Arch Linux package)
    -Didn't support bookmark importing, but replacing the
    ~/.midori/bookmarks.xbel file with the generated file
    worked perfectly. Drawback  is  that  any  pre-extant
    bookmarks are lost.

Opera (9.64 qtstatic for Linux)
    -Worked perfectly with the generated .adr file

Firefox (3.5.1 Arch Linux package)
    -Other than tagging not yet being supported on import
    /export, everything worked perfectly.
