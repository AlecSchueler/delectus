Delectus is a tool for backing up Delicious.com bookmarks
in a variety of formats.Because many browsers are able to
import bookmarks in these formats, it can also be used to
transfer boomarks from Delicious into your web browser.

The following formats are currently supported by Delectus:

	* XBEL, version 1.0
	* Opera ADR, version 2.0
	* (Netscape) HTML, version 1

And the following browsers have been tested and are able
to import bookmark files generated by Delectus:

	* Arora
	* Epiphany
	* Firefox
	* Midori
	* Opera

Support for private  bookmarks has now been added,  but 
requires a password to be given when prompted.  Delectus
could still be used in a script, with the password given
using the "expect" command.

Dependencies
Delectus is designed to be lightweight and, as such, has
very few dependencies.  To run the program you will need
a Python (2.5/2.6) interpreter,and each of the following
modules:
	* optparse
	* re
	* sys
	* time
	* urllib

Note that all of the above are contained in the CPython
standard library.

To install from github, then you'll need git installed
to clone the repository.
