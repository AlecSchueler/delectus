Delectus is a tool for backing up Delicious.com bookmarks
in a variety of formats.Because many browsers are able to
import bookmarks in these formats, it can also be used to
transfer boomarks from Delicious into your web browser.

The following formats are currently supported by Delectus:

	* XBEL, version 1.0
	* Opera ADR, version 2.0
	* (Netscape) HTML, version 1

And the following browsers have been tested and are able
to import bookmark files generated by Delectus:

	* Arora
	* Epiphany
	* Firefox
	* Midori
	* Opera

There is currently no support for private boomarks, but
this feature is intended to be introduced in the future.

Dependancies
Delectus is designed to be lightweight and, as such, has
very few dependancies.  To run the program you will need
a Python (2.5/2.6) interpreter,and each of the following
modules:
	* optparse
	* re
	* sys
	* time
	* urllib

Note that all of the above are contained in the CPython
standard library.

Note:
    del_api.py is an incomplete reworking of delectus 
designed to better use the Delicious API. Until it is
complete you should use "delectus" instead.
