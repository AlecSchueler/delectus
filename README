This is still very much a work in progress, but a working prototype
is complete. Something usable should appear here without too much
delay. If you're interested in the script, then check back soon.

The inspiration for this came after magnolia's database was lost,
and I worried about what I'd do if anything similar were to happen
to delicious. Perhaps support for magnolia &c. will be added in 
the future.

Formats to be supported are:
    * XBEL
    * Netscape HTML
    * Opera ADR
